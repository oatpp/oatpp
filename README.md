# Oat++ 

Oat++ is a modern Web Framework for C++. 
It's fully loaded and contains all necessary components for effective production level development. 
It's also light and has a small memory footprint.

## Quick Overview

**Shortcuts:**

- [Oat++ High Level Overview](https://oatpp.io/docs/start/high-level-overview/) - Get a quick overview of Oat++ features.
- [Example Project](https://github.com/oatpp/example-crud) - A complete example of a "CRUD" service (UserService) built with Oat++. REST + Swagger-UI + SQLite.

### Build Powerful API And Document It With Swagger-UI

See [ApiController](https://oatpp.io/docs/components/api-controller/) for more details.

```cpp
ENDPOINT_INFO(getUserById) {
  info->summary = "Get one User by userId";

  info->addResponse<Object<UserDto>>(Status::CODE_200, "application/json");
  info->addResponse<Object<StatusDto>>(Status::CODE_404, "application/json");
  info->addResponse<Object<StatusDto>>(Status::CODE_500, "application/json");

  info->pathParams["userId"].description = "User Identifier";
}
ENDPOINT("GET", "users/{userId}", getUserById,
         PATH(Int32, userId))
{
  return createDtoResponse(Status::CODE_200, m_userService.getUserById(userId));
}
``` 

### Access Databases And Keep Your Data Consistent

See [Oat++ ORM](https://oatpp.io/docs/components/orm/) for more details.

```cpp
QUERY(createUser,
      "INSERT INTO users (username, email, role) VALUES (:username, :email, :role);",
      PARAM(oatpp::String, username), 
      PARAM(oatpp::String, email), 
      PARAM(oatpp::Enum<UserRoles>::AsString, role))
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: "Oat++" name?

- "Oat" is something light, organic, and green. It can be easily cooked and consumed with no effort. 
- "++" gives a hint that it is "something" for C++.

### Q: What is the main area of Oat++ application?

Oat++ is used for many different purposes, from building REST APIs that run on embedded devices to 
building microservices and highly-loaded cloud applications.

But the majority of use cases appears to be in **IoT** and **Robotics**.

### Q: How portable is Oat++?

Theoretically, Oat++ can be **easily** ported everywhere where you have **threads** and **network stack**.
With an additional comparably small effort, it can be ported almost everywhere depending on how
much you strip it and what would be the final binary size.

See [supported platforms](https://oatpp.io/supported-platforms/) for additional info.

### Q: What is the size of a minimal Oat++ application?

About **1Mb**, depending on C/C++ std-lib and oatpp version.

### Q: Which Oat++ API to choose, Simple or Async?

Always choose **Simple API** wherever possible. Simple API is more developed and makes the code cleaner.

Async API is designed for small, specific tasks that run at high concurrency levels ex.:
- Serving file downloads to a large number of concurrent users (1K users and more).
- Streaming to a large number of clients (1K or more).
- Websocket Chat servers.

For all other purposes use simple API.
